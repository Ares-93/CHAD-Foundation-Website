            Once upon a time, there was a grand, strapping young man named Chad
            who loved athletics, history, people, and life. He believed in
            nurturing a healthy body, mind, and spirit. He never drank, smoked,
            or did drugs. He was loved by many friends and family members for
            his exuberance, optimism, curiosity, and joyfulness.
            <br />
            <br />
            One day he went out to play in his football league in the City of
            Angels. It was a glorious, sunny day â€“ a great day for a game. But
            God, the grand Coach of Everything, had other plans for his fair Son
            that day, April 23, 1994, and drafted him to the Highest Team for a
            Higher Purpose. Chad was just 26 years old.{" "}
