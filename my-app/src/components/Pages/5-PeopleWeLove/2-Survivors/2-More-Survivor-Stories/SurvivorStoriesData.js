      The club announced Monday that due to a serious heart condition, their 2010 MLS SuperDraft
      second-round pick will be forced to retire before playing his first professional match. Says TFC's
      official website: Herold suffers from the condition Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) –
      which causes abnormal thickening of a part of the heart muscle. With this condition, under
      strenuous exercise, there is a risk of developing a potentially fatal irregular heart rhythm, or
      arrhythmia. Unfortunately, the only way to reduce this risk is to put significant life-long
      restrictions on exercise. “Announcing my retirement from soccer at this age is something I never,
      ever thought would happen to me,” said Zac Herold. “I am grateful to Dr. Smith, and all the specialists I’ve seen over the last few months – this news was very hard to take but I know it’s
      the best decision for me and my health. My parents have been with me every step of the way, and
      it means so much to me that I’m able to retire as a Toronto FC player. The whole team has been
      wonderful to me and my family and although it’ll be a tough day, I’m looking forward to seeing
      everyone on the 22nd." Toronto FC supporters will find it extremely troubling that Mo or anyone
      else at the club didn't know about such a serious condition before the pick was made, only to
      discover Zac’s problem through the team tests after he was drafted and his Generation Adidas
      contract was signed. Even still, it's better that they found out when they did instead of having
      something horrible happen on the pitch.

    story: `
    When this youngster was 6 months old, his parents who were playing in the CHAD Volleyball Benefit, took advantage of the heart screenings performed by cardiologists from Children’s Hospital Los Angeles Heart Institute.  The doctors found a hole in the heart of their baby which was confirmed with further testing.  They had to wait 6 months for the baby’s heart to grow, and then surgery was performed to correct the defect.
    The father related the story to me at the following year’s tourney.  He said he had no idea and thought his baby had a cold and just wasn’t feeling well.  Today, this youngster is 9 years old and comes with his siblings to the tourney to be screened, and his Mom and Dad invite other friends who bring their children to have the testing.  When the CHAD screenings first took place in Hermosa Beach, spectators and players were more hesitant to sign up for the life-saving testing.  It was a younger, seemingly healthy, athletic crowd, but their awareness was raised that Sudden Cardiac Arrest can happen at any age, at any time, and with a 15% anomaly finding rate everyone of every age was soon in line waiting for their screenings, sometimes before or between games.  It was a good thing that spread like wildfire, year after year, the importance of heart health at any age and taking advantage of preventive screenings to safeguard it.

    When Mack took the mound in the bottom of the first, his calm demeanor turned to nervousness, making that first-pitch strike on the outside part of the plate harder than it looked. This happens all the time. "Right before the game starts, right before the first pitch, it's pounding."  Mack was referring to his heart, which beats a little faster and a little harder when the umpire calls for the initial pitch. There was a chance Hale might not have had the opportunity to make that pitch this year. Last October, during a heart screening at Holyoke High School performed by The Chad Foundation, Hale learned he suffered from a dilated left ventricle. More visits with doctors followed at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, the cardiology clinic at Children's Hospital Boston in Waltham and Boston Children's Hospital. With each appointment came an assurance that Hale was OK and he could play sports.
Mack planned a baseball derby to raise funds to bring a CHAD screening for the athletes of his own Northampton High School. CHAD was delighted to provide a screening at his high school for all this teammates. A few years ago, Mack graduated Magna Cum Laude from Middlebury College (VT) with a degree in Molecular Biology & Biochemistry with departmental honors. “Cardiology is definitely a huge interest for me. It's something I saw a lot of when I was undergoing all of the testing in high school for my enlarged left ventricle. Some type of surgery is also a major interest of mine.”

    When Mackenzie’s brother returned home from college, January 5, 2012, Mack recounts, ‘in an effort to stay true to his commitment to the team, Jonathan was completing an hour-long rowing workout on an ergometer he brought home from school when he experienced a severe and deadly arrhythmia. Attempts by his brother, Mom, and EMTs failed to revive him. Doctors and pathologists surmise that he died of a probable arrhythmia from an unknown cause.’   
    Can the light shine through such sadness? Jonno’s 22-year-old brother, Mack, says, yes. Because of the unknown cause of his brother, Jonathan’s arrhythmia and the potential for genetic conditions, Mackenzie was screened with an EKG, which detected an anomaly. An Echocardiogram determined an enlarged and mildly dilated right ventricle. Doctors initially believed that Mac suffered from a condition called ARVD, which can cause deadly arrhythmias with vigorous exercise- certainly a threat for a serious runner. A second Echocardiogram revealed an Atrial Septal Defect, which was responsible for the enlargement. As a 7-time marathoner and generally active person, Mac was stunned to learn that he had a nickel-sized hole in his heart without any symptoms. Mac credits his brother Jonathan with saving his Life. Mackenzie underwent open-heart surgery on April 19, 2013, and was able to return to running without the fear of a stroke, right ventricular failure, or death caused by the defect. He is a survivor because of cardiac screening.’
    CHAD came back in 2012 and 2013 to provide heart screenings at Holyoke High School, MA in special tribute of Mac’s brother, Jonno Gray.

She is a certified CPR/AED trainer. Honouring Children – Survivors Learn about heart screenings for you and your family. You may have no symptoms and no family history of heart disease or Sudden Cardiac Arrest, but neither do many victims of SCA. Simple cardiac tests, including Electrocardiograms (ECG’s) and Echocardiograms, are capable of discovering a wealth of information about your heart…examinations that are important for everyone. Many young people have underlying heart conditions with no symptoms `,

    “I have been meaning to write and thank you for all the spectacular work The Chad Foundation has been doing across the country. I am especially appreciative because I am one of the lives you might have saved. Due to your echocardiogram screening at the Chad Foundation Malibu Benefit for Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, doctors detected an arrhythmia and advised immediate follow-up which I did and ended up having surgery the following month in October, with a diagnosis of Wolf-Parkinson-White Syndrome. All my life I suffered from this undiagnosed physical challenge and played NCAA Division 1 volleyball at USC and never could play to my optimum. Now, I am playing sports better than ever thanks to your fortuitous screening event. I would be honored to be a spokesperson for your cause, of which I am living proof!”`,
