      "It was the summer after Emilie’s younger sister, Anne, graduated from high school that Emilie returned home. It was the 30th of August, and the two girls were looking forward to a sisterly trip to see their brother in college in Flagstaff. The alarm clock kept going off continually, which brought their Mom into the room to find out why. That is when Mom, Christine, discovered her daughter, Emilie, was not breathing. She died at just 22 years old of an undiagnosed heart anomaly.",

      "Anne remembers after her sister’s passing, there were genetic tests and she wore a Holter monitor to monitor her heart rhythm. Anne said about her big sister: 'She was 6’2 ½”, very pretty, with long brunette hair. She was shy, awkward with boys, played basketball, always athletic, and always wanted a boyfriend. She wanted to be accepted and fit in; she never said anything mean about anyone, didn’t have problems, and never argued with parents or friends. She was a NICE person, and everyone liked her. I'm envious of anyone who has a sister. When I see people angry at their sisters and yelling at each other, I think, to have a sister around would be such a neat relationship.' (Read more about Anne’s story about her sister, Emilie, in ‘Sisters/Brothers,’ in the book, “CHAD, A Celebration of Life – Beyond A Mother’s Memories.”)",

      "Miles Kirkland was passionate about his game and was embroiled in football drills when he collapsed suddenly. He succumbed to undiagnosed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. His mother, Tanza, began to see the full impact the gentle giant (as he was known) had on so many friends and teens, and the community at large. Councilwoman Deb Rose nicknamed Miles ‘The Shovel’ for his work ethic in re-beautifying the plant beds near the precinct with such passion and care for the H.E.A.L.T.H for YOUTHS gardening project.",

      "Tanza had so many teenagers tell her what support and encouragement Miles had shown each of them. 'Miles didn’t brag about what he was doing he just did it!' A young lady who Miles worked with in the summer said she was struggling in nursing and Miles told her she could do it, and he would help and they would do it together. There was a young man on Curtis JV who told Tanza that even though others were discouraging and telling him he couldn’t play, Miles took him through the weight room and taught and showed him what to do. Another young woman shared her story and said Miles and she had a special relationship because Miles said to her he didn’t believe that since they are different in color—she could care about him because he was black and she was white, but that young woman let Miles know that she loved him just like a brother. Tanza says, 'My entire family is grateful and humbled by the CURTIS WARRIORS and the coaches because whether they know it or not they were her strength during this season and it was rough for everyone; but for that short period of time that we watched them play with their hearts and dedication; it felt as though Miles was still here!' The Chad Foundation for Athletes and Artists was proud to provide heart screenings (EKGs and ECHOs), and cholesterol and diabetes testing for 3 years to his teammates, the Curtis Warriors, in honour of their favorite son, Miles T. Kirkland.",

      "As for myself, when problems arose, I learned to fix them. I grew up feeling that I could fix just about anything if I put my mind to it. I became a Registered Nurse; nurses take care of everyone and everything. But the one thing I couldn’t prevent, couldn’t fix, would never get a second chance at, and never even saw it coming, was a parent’s worst nightmare... On December 31, 2002, I got the phone call that drained the life from me. Janna was found unconscious in her bed. The ambulance came. I was told later in the emergency room that, 'They were never able to get a heartbeat.' Soon after Janna passed, I found out that what she had was an electrical problem with her heart, called Long QT Syndrome. It could have been detected with a simple, inexpensive electrocardiogram (ECG) read by a cardiologist. For what other segment of the population do we completely ignore such life-threatening, yet detectable and treatable medical issues? I realize that I cannot fix the past, but I can do my best to ensure that Janna’s having lived on this earth will help light the way for others. I love you with all my heart, Janna. Until we meet again… (More on Janna’s story can be found in the Chad foundation book, 'CHAD, A Celebration of Life - Beyond A Mother’s Memories.')",

      "He was the picture of good health. He was careful with his diet and had a good exercise routine—he was practicing good health habits. He valued his life and well-being. Unfortunately, it took a practice soccer session to turn tragedy for me to learn three important lessons. 1. What AEDs are and why they are needed and, 2. Why it is important to pursue heart testing as a result of certain symptoms, and 3. Why family history is so important to a child’s physician. – Toni Pellegrini, Mother of Louis T. Savino, III (Lorraine Sikora, Aunt to Louis Savino) I had seen him [my nephew] only days before. We chatted about his sophomore year. He even sat down at his piano and played several tunes for me, and I enjoyed every minute of it. By the time a kind neighbor drove me to the hospital, this young, vibrant, intelligent, compassionate, beautiful young person had gone away. Within days of the tragedy, I began conducting Internet research to determine the frequency and cause of sudden cardiac death.

      "We lost Chad but Chuck Morrell would lose 5 members of his family to this silent killer, HCM. Today, we know, the HCM gene is found in 1 in 500 births, back then the awareness of the disease was still under the cover of night. First, Chuck lost his baby sister, Michelle, at 3 yrs. old to this disease; perhaps thankfully she died in her sleep. Five years later, they would lose their Mom at age 54 to the same heart ailment. Chuck had a twin named Gary, whose son Kyle, would collapse walking home and subsequently die at age 12. Finally, all were tested and it was found that the twin brothers, Chuck and Gary, also possessed the lethal gene, as well as Gary’s other children, Desiree and Mitchell. Mitchell only two years older than his brother Kyle, would also succumb to the disease just a short while later. Thankfully, the daughter would survive and I would have the pleasure of meeting her son Tyler at a heart screening event; he had just received an internal defibrillator, a device that shocks the heart should it go into an erratic arrhythmia so it can start beating at a normal rhythm again. I would also meet Chuck’s lovely daughter, Holly, who would also be diagnosed with HCM and now also has the lifesaving ICD implanted within. In honouring her family, Holly founded her organization, 'Heartfelt Cardiac Programs,' which has been doing community preventive screenings for 17 years. Holly’s Dad, Chuck, had a heart transplant in 1995 and always said as he had been given a younger heart, that that’s what kept him young.",
