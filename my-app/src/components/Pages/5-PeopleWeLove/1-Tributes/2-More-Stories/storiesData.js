    story: `
    It was the summer after Emilie’s younger sister, Anne, graduated from high school that Emilie returned home.
    It was the 30th of August, and the two girls were looking forward to a sisterly trip to see their brother in college in Flagstaff.
    The alarm clock kept going off continually, which brought their Mom into the room to find out why. That is when Mom, Christine,
    discovered her daughter, Emilie, was not breathing. She died at just 22 years old of an undiagnosed heart anomaly.

    Anne remembers after her sister’s passing, there were genetic tests and she wore a Holter monitor to monitor her heart rhythm.
    Anne said about her big sister: "She was 6’2 ½”, very pretty, with long brunette hair. She was shy, awkward with boys, played
    basketball, always athletic, and always wanted a boyfriend. She wanted to be accepted and fit in; she never said anything
    mean about anyone, didn’t have problems, and never argued with parents or friends. She was a NICE person, and everyone
    liked her.

    I'm envious of anyone who has a sister. When I see people angry at their sisters and yelling at each other, I think, to have
    a sister around would be such a neat relationship.”

    Beyond A Mother’s Memories.)

    story: `Miles Kirkland was passionate about his game and was embroiled in football drills when he collapsed suddenly.  He succumbed to undiagnosed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. His mother, Tanza, began to see the full impact the gentle giant (as he was known) had on so many friends and teens, and the community at large. Councilwoman Deb Rose nicknamed Miles ‘The Shovel’ for his work ethic in re-beautifying the plant beds near the precinct with such passion and care for the H.E.A.L.T.H for YOUTHS gardening project. Tanza had so many teenagers tell her what support and encouragement Miles had showed each of them. “Miles didn’t brag about what he was doing he just did it!” A young lady who Miles worked with in the summer said she was struggling in nursing and Miles told her she could do it, and he would help and they would do it together.
    There was a young man on Curtis JV who told Tanza that even though others were discouraging and telling him he couldn’t play, Miles took him through the weight room and taught and showed him what to do. Another young woman shared her story and said Miles and she had a special relationship because Miles said to her he didn’t believe that since they are different in color- she could care about him because he was black and she was white, but that young woman let Miles know that she loved him just like a brother. Tanza says, my entire family is grateful and humbled by the CURTIS WARRIORS and the coaches because whether they know it or not they were her strength during this season and it was rough for everyone; but for that short period of time that we watched them play with their hearts and dedication; it felt as though Miles was still here! The Chad Foundation for Athletes and Artists was proud to provide heart screenings (EKGs and ECHOs), and cholesterol and diabetes testing for 3 years to his teammates, the Curtis Warriors, in honour of their favorite son, Miles T.

    story: `I am Janna’s mom. Janna was my gift for everything I’d ever done right in my life. From the moment she was born, I knew she
    was special. I loved watching Janna grow. Even at her young age she was intuitive and sensitive, determined and capable,
    responsible and caring. I marveled at her thoughtful opinions; I always took them into great consideration. She loved to just
    laugh and be silly. She matured with confidence and the resolve to create her own path in life. As for myself, when problems
    arose, I learned to fix them. I grew up feeling that I could fix just about anything if I put my mind to it. I became a Registered
    Nurse; nurses take care of everyone and everything. But the one thing I couldn’t prevent, couldn’t fix, would never get a second
    chance at, and never even saw it coming, was a parent’s worst nightmare... On December 31, 2002, I got the phone call that
    drained the life from me. Janna was found unconscious in her bed. The ambulance came. I was told later in the emergency
    room that, “They were never able to get a heartbeat.” Soon after Janna passed, I found out that what she had was an electrical
    problem with her heart, called Long QT Syndrome. It could have been detected with a simple, inexpensive electrocardiogram
    (ECG) read by a cardiologist. For what other segment of the population do we completely ignore such life-threatening, yet
    detectable and treatable medical issues? I realize that I cannot fix the past, but I can do my best to ensure that Janna’s having
    lived on this earth will help light the way for others. I love you with all my heart, Janna. Until we meet again… (More on Janna’s
    story can be found in the foundation book, “CHAD, A Celebration of Life-Beyond A Mother’s Memories.”)`,

    story: `Louis collapsed on the field while practicing soccer. This was all due to Louis being misdiagnosed with having physical induced asthma, I
    would later learn from the coroner that the autopsy report evidenced Louis had a heart defect known as HCM (hypertrophic
    cardiomyopathy). Within weeks, I soon realized my son&#39;s case was not isolated, and within two months, we had formed the Louis T.
    Savino, III Foundation. I would have never dreamed that my son was living with a silent killer. He was the picture of good health. He was
    careful with his diet and had a good exercise routine—he was practicing good health habits. He valued his life and well-being.
    Unfortunately, it took a practice soccer session to turn tragedy for me to learn three important lessons. 1. What AEDs are and why they are
    needed and, 2. Why it is important to pursue heart testing as a result of certain symptoms, and 3. Why family history is so important to a
    child&#39;s physician. – Toni Pellegrini, Mother of Louis T. Savino, III
    I had seen him [my nephew] only days before. We chatted about his sophomore year. He even sat down at his piano and played several
    tunes for me, and I enjoyed every minute of it. By the time a kind neighbor drove me to the hospital, this young, vibrant, intelligent,
    compassionate, beautiful young person had gone away. Within days of the tragedy, I began conducting Internet research to determine the
    frequency and cause of sudden cardiac death in young people. I&#39;ve since learned that those cold and inhumane &quot;statistics&quot; cannot possibly capture the pain and
    overwhelming grief of losing a vibrant, young person. What he could have done and what he chose to do in his 15 years is what made him such a wonderful example for
    each of us. We are hopeful that the Louis T. Savino, III Foundation will not only keep Louis’ spirit and legacy alive but also hopefully save precious, young lives. –

    Memories.”)`,
