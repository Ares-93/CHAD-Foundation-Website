    story: `
    It was the summer after Emilie’s younger sister, Anne, graduated from high school that Emilie
    returned home. It was the 30th of August, and the two girls were looking forward to a sisterly
    trip to see their brother in college in Flagstaff. The alarm clock kept going off continually, which
    brought their Mom into the room to find out why. That is when Mom, Christine, discovered her
    daughter, Emilie, was not breathing. She died at just 22 years old of an undiagnosed heart
    anomaly. Anne remembers after her sister’s passing, there were genetic tests and she wore a
    Holter monitor to monitor her heart rhythm. Anne said about her big sister: "She was 6’2 ½”,
    very pretty, with long brunette hair. She was shy, awkward with boys, played basketball, always
    athletic, and always wanted a boyfriend. She wanted to be accepted and fit in; she never said
    anything mean about anyone, didn’t have problems, and never argued with parents or friends.
    She was a NICE person, and everyone liked her. I'm envious of anyone who has a sister. When I
    see people angry at their sisters and yelling at each other, I think, to have a sister around would
    be such a neat relationship.” (Read more about Anne’s story about her sister, Emilie, in
    ‘Sisters/Brothers,’ in the book, “CHAD, A Celebration of Life – Beyond A Mother’s
    Memories.)”

    story: `
    Miles Kirkland was passionate about his game and was embroiled in football drills when he
    collapsed suddenly. He succumbed to undiagnosed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. His mother,Tanza, began to see the full impact the gentle giant (as he was known) had on so many friends
    and teens, and the community at large. Councilwoman Deb Rose nicknamed Miles ‘The Shovel’
    for his work ethic in re-beautifying the plant beds near the precinct with such passion and care
    for the H.E.A.L.T.H for YOUTHS gardening project. Tanza had so many teenagers tell her what
    support and encouragement Miles had shown each of them. “Miles didn’t brag about what he
    was doing he just did it!” A young lady who Miles worked with in the summer said she was
    struggling in nursing and Miles told her she could do it, and he would help and they would do it
    together. There was a young man on Curtis JV who told Tanza that even though others were
    discouraging and telling him he couldn’t play Miles took him through the weight room and
    taught and showed him what to do. Another young woman shared her story and said Miles and
    she had a special relationship because Miles said to her he didn’t believe that since they are
    different in color- she could care about him because he was black and she was white, but that
    young woman let Miles know that she loved him just like a brother. Tanza says, my entire family
    is grateful and humbled by the CURTIS WARRIORS and the coaches because whether they
    know it or not they were her strength during this season and it was rough for everyone; but for
    that short period of time that we watched them play with their hearts and dedication; it felt as
    though Miles was still here! The Chad Foundation for Athletes and Artists was proud to provide
    heart screenings (EKGs and ECHOs), and cholesterol and diabetes testing for 3 years to his
    teammates, the Curtis Warriors, in honour of their favorite son, Miles T. Kirkland.

    story: `I am Janna’s mom. Janna was my gift for everything I’d ever done right in my life. From the moment she was born, I knew she
    was special. I loved watching Janna grow. Even at her young age she was intuitive and sensitive, determined and capable,
    responsible and caring. I marveled at her thoughtful opinions; I always took them into great consideration. She loved to just
    laugh and be silly. She matured with confidence and the resolve to create her own path in life. As for myself, when problems
    arose, I learned to fix them. I grew up feeling that I could fix just about anything if I put my mind to it. I became a Registered
    Nurse; nurses take care of everyone and everything. But the one thing I couldn’t prevent, couldn’t fix, would never get a second
    chance at, and never even saw it coming, was a parent’s worst nightmare... On December 31, 2002, I got the phone call that
    drained the life from me. Janna was found unconscious in her bed. The ambulance came. I was told later in the emergency
    room that, “They were never able to get a heartbeat.” Soon after Janna passed, I found out that what she had was an electrical
    problem with her heart, called Long QT Syndrome. It could have been detected with a simple, inexpensive electrocardiogram
    (ECG) read by a cardiologist. For what other segment of the population do we completely ignore such life-threatening, yet
    detectable and treatable medical issues? I realize that I cannot fix the past, but I can do my best to ensure that Janna’s having
    lived on this earth will help light the way for others. I love you with all my heart, Janna. Until we meet again… (More on Janna’s
    story can be found in the foundation book, “CHAD, A Celebration of Life-Beyond A Mother’s Memories.”)`,

    story: `Louis collapsed on the field while practicing soccer. This was all due to Louis being misdiagnosed with having physical induced asthma, I
    would later learn from the coroner that the autopsy report evidenced Louis had a heart defect known as HCM (hypertrophic
    cardiomyopathy). Within weeks, I soon realized my son&#39;s case was not isolated, and within two months, we had formed the Louis T.
    Savino, III Foundation. I would have never dreamed that my son was living with a silent killer. He was the picture of good health. He was
    careful with his diet and had a good exercise routine—he was practicing good health habits. He valued his life and well-being.
    Unfortunately, it took a practice soccer session to turn tragedy for me to learn three important lessons. 1. What AEDs are and why they are
    needed and, 2. Why it is important to pursue heart testing as a result of certain symptoms, and 3. Why family history is so important to a
    child&#39;s physician. – Toni Pellegrini, Mother of Louis T. Savino, III
    I had seen him [my nephew] only days before. We chatted about his sophomore year. He even sat down at his piano and played several
    tunes for me, and I enjoyed every minute of it. By the time a kind neighbor drove me to the hospital, this young, vibrant, intelligent,
    compassionate, beautiful young person had gone away. Within days of the tragedy, I began conducting Internet research to determine the
    frequency and cause of sudden cardiac death in young people. I&#39;ve since learned that those cold and inhumane &quot;statistics&quot; cannot possibly capture the pain and
    overwhelming grief of losing a vibrant, young person. What he could have done and what he chose to do in his 15 years is what made him such a wonderful example for
    each of us. We are hopeful that the Louis T. Savino, III Foundation will not only keep Louis’ spirit and legacy alive but also hopefully save precious, young lives. –

    story: `The Morrell Family was headed by the handsome rogue, Chuck Morrell, former footballer
    (Washington Redskins) and actor (Banacek). Ironically, just like Chad, who was coming out of a huddle
    when he collapsed face down, Chuck was running for a touchdown as a WSU Cougar, when he, too,
    collapsed face-down with no apparent reason – there was no one anywhere near him. But unlike Chad,
    Chuck got up, having just made the longest run in the Cougar books, 87 yards—fortuitous? Yes, for that
    moment, a grand record never to be broken only tied and many years later. We lost Chad but Chuck
    Morrell would lose 5 members of his family to this silent killer, HCM. Today, we know, the HCM gene
    is found in 1 in 500 births, back then the awareness of the disease was still under the cover of night.
    First, Chuck lost his baby sister, Michelle, but 3yrs. old to this disease; perhaps thankfully she
    died in her sleep. Five years later, they would lose their Mom at age 54 to the same heart ailment.
    Chuck had a twin named , Gary, whose son Kyle, would collapse walking home and subsequently die at
    age 12. Finally, all were tested and it was found that the twin brothers, Chuck and Gary, also possessed
    the lethal gene, as well as Gary’s other children, Desiree and Mitchell. Mitchell only two years older
    than his brother Kyle, would also succumb to the disease just a short while later. Thankfully, the
    daughter would survive and I would have the pleasure of meeting her son Tyler at the event; he had just
    received an internal defibrillator, a device that shocks the heart should it go into an erratic arrhythmia so
    it can start beating at a normal rhythm again. I would also meet Chuck’s lovely daughter, Holly, who
    would also be diagnosed with HCM and now also has that lifesaving ICD implanted within. In
    honouring her family, she founded her organization, “Heartfelt Cardiac Programs,” which has been
    doing community preventive screenings for 15 years. We have held hands at our screening programs and
    shared the echocardiographic machines thanks to Philips! Holly, too, is part of my ‘Heart Family.’
    Chuck had a heart transplant in 1995 and always said as he had been given a younger heart, that
    that’s what kept him young. He had to say goodbye to his twin, Gary, too, who chose not to have a
    transplant and succumbed to the disease.In 2005, Chuck himself lost the battle but it was hard-fought
    one just like his daughter Holly would fight when she underwent open-heart surgery recently and
    survived. It’s important to pay tribute to the pioneers and pillars of our cause. They are who and what
    give us heart to continue the fight when we get tired-- the stamina to get up and keep doing. Honouring
    The Morrell Family, the 5 members taken by HCM and those Survivors who devoting their lives to
    saving hearts.`,

    story: `For where your treasure is there will your heart be also."  His buddies came early, knocking at his window. They rode bikes, played Nintendo 64, and I saw David smiling with his friends as he shot hoops. We always looked forward to Saturday afternoons as we all piled in the car to watch David play basketball. But within two minutes into the game, our perfect lives turned to blackness as we helplessly watched as David suffered a cardiac arrest on the gym floor. If a defibrillator had been on the scene, David could have survived and with treatment, he could have lived a long life.
    David's Grandma's letter of encouragement to David before his departure: I think you are a "winner" and so does Grandpa. Always remember the song you love "We are the Champions" because it is what you will always be. Coach Rick Hughes: "I could write pages upon pages of what a tremendous young man David was, but I think all I will say is that I have never been associated with anyone with higher integrity, morals, or a more courageous heart."  Mom: The David Deuel Bill has passed here, in Nevada, enabling automated external defibrillators at public facilities without fear of liability to the trained user. Sudden cardiac death is called the "silent epidemic" and much more needs to be done to save lives. We are heartbroken and we miss our David every moment. His enthusiasm for sports and life was contagious. Through Jesus Christ, we know we will be with him again.  "We love you David." "Thank You for a glimpse of Heaven." – Mom (Kathy Deuel) (..more about David and other Sudden Cardiac Victims can be found in the foundation book, “CHAD, A Celebration of Life – Beyond  A Mother’s Memories.”)

    three and played competitively until the time of his passing. As many of Kevin’s teammates would tell you, his motto was “No
    Excuses, Play Like A Champion”. Off the ice or field, Kevin would live by another motto: “Live Every Day, Laugh
    Every Moment, Love Beyond Words.” Unfortunately, on July 11, 2011, this physical “big heart” took our son,
    brother, grandson, and friend from this earth. What we would later discover, Kevin actually had a condition that is
    called “Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM).´ The Kevin J. Major Youth Sports Foundation will sponsor cardiac
    screenings for youth athletes in our community. Each screening will include an EKG, ECHO cardiogram, cholesterol,
    and glucose screening along with blood pressure checks, education on CPR, and AEDʼs. The value of these
    screenings is $3,000 each. Our goal is to help raise awareness of “Sudden Cardiac Arrest” through education,
    cardiovascular screenings for young athletes and providing AEDs.`,

    While we miss our little angel Vanessa more than we could possibly express in a letter, my husband and I realize that we must choose to either envelop ourselves in self-pity and shy from the world, or latch on to the deeper meaning and a better understanding of the frailty of life on Earth and to embrace even more the remaining moments we have. Due to the support of friends and family, we have clearly chosen the latter and are looking for ways to add meaning and purpose not only to Vanessa's life, but to ours as well. That being said, we joined.
    cures for cardiomyopathy in children.  I would also like to put my energy into organizing a Free echo-screening.
    We joined the Children's Cardiomyopathy Foundation (childrenscardiomyopathy.org) and we are dedicated helping uncover causes for children in my area. I live in Houston, TX and I am in close contact with the Texas Children's Hospital Cardiologists which I hope will join me in my efforts.
